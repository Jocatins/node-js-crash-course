### Notes

The reason why JavaScript runs on browsers is because it has a V8 engine in browsers which compiles
JS into machine code
Node.js is written in C++, so it can run directly on computers
The V8 engine lives inside Node as well, so it can compiles JS codes into machine codes.
Node adds extra functionality like

-   Read and write files on a computer
-   Connect to a db
-   Act as a server for content

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
